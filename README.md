# Spotify Top 50 Country Playlists Database Design
## Motivation
[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/) generates a variety of playlists that their users can listen to.  This database stores information on the top 50 songs of 67 countries. Spotify creates their own playlists for the top 50 most popular songs,  and this database stores information of 67 different countries and their most popular songs.   This would allow researchers to understand what kind of musical characteristics countries like listening to.

Music is deeply rooted in cultures across the globe. Another goal for this database is to help us better understand cultures based on the music popular in their respective countries.
